# Simon Game - Course Challenge Project

## Overview

Welcome to my course challenge project for **The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp** on Udemy! In this project, I have built a game that is modeled after the classic game **Simon**. The game provides an interactive and challenging experience where players test their memory and pattern recognition skills.

## Project Description

The Simon Game is a memory-based game where players are presented with a sequence of tiles, each with a specific color or symbol. Players need to replicate the sequence by clicking on the tiles in the correct order. As players progress through the levels, the patterns become more complex, increasing the difficulty of the game. The game ends when a player makes a mistake or clicks the wrong tile.

## Features

- Interactive and engaging gameplay.
- Increasing difficulty levels to challenge players.
- Responsive design for a seamless experience on various devices.
